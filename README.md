# Graeme-s-Quiz
My assignment to create a Coding Quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

To my understanding my assignment was to make the quiz start when the user presses the start button. Then they are presented with ten multiple-choice questions and a timer. Wrong answers take ten seconds off the 100-second timer. If they run out of time, the user is taunted with an audio file calling them an idiot. If they finish the quiz, they are prompted to write their name, upon which their scores are saved to local storage, and then printed onto the high-scores display card.

This is the result: https://threebraincells.github.io/Graeme-s-Quiz/
